If you want to verify the jwt returned by ADFS (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED) you must install the following:
```
pip install PyJWT
pip install cryptography
```

If you use a private PKI for the ADFS server, you will need to perform the following steps to trust the CA until https://github.com/certifi/python-certifi/issues/22 is resolved:
```
pip install certifi

python -m certifi "where()"

cat /path/to/trusted.pem >> /path/to/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem
```


If you are using Python 2.x, you will need to install the following packages to communicate with ADFS using certificates from your internal certificate authority:
```
pip install pyopenssl
pip install ndg-httpsclient
```
